# Dual-issue-superscalar-CPU-core
This is a MIPS dual-issue superscalar CPU core basing on MIPS32 Architecture. This work was finished by Zhongyu Qiu, Yangbin Yu, Shengrong Yang and Xuming Yang in August,2019.

This CPU core can work on FPGA written in Verilog. The FPGA project is created by nscscc2019 which you can download from their website. Mybe nscscc2020 also work well but I don't test. Just download the nscscc2019 project and our Verilog codes, and put our CPU core codes in the file myCPU.

Thanks for my partner again! They are Zhongyu Qiu, Yangbin Yu, Shengrong Yang. They help me a lot when we worked together.
